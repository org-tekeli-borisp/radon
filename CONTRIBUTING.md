## CONTRIBUTING.md

**The guidelines for contributing are not very strict since i doubt that this will get big but none the less**

# To contribute to the project

- All code must be "somewhat" well written 
- The pull request should be "somewhat" concise and well written
- Rust/C/Shell code is preferred but other languages are also fine

# To make your project compatiable with radon

- Must use either **Make** **CMake** or **Cargo** 
- Havent tested projects with multiple build files but im pretty sure they wont cause a problem
